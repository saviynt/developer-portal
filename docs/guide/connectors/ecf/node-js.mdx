Follow below steps to create a node-js based web server adhering ECF spec.

## Steps to generate node-js server bundle.

1. Open Swagger Editor in web broswer by navigating to [https://editor.swagger.io/](https://github.com/saviynt/ExternalConnectorFramework-APISpec/blob/main/README.md#steps-to-generate-node-js-server-bundle)
2. In the editor window, click on File --&gt; Import file and select the OpenAPISpec.yaml from the spec directory of ExternalConnectorFramework-apispec project (ensure that you have already checked this out)
3. You should be able to render the API specification on right panel.
4. Now go to Generate Server -&gt; nodejs-server
5. This will generate a zip file.

## Steps to start node-js server.

1. Install nodejs from [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://github.com/saviynt/ExternalConnectorFramework-APISpec/blob/main/README.md#steps-to-generate-node-js-server-bundle).

2. Unzip the generated zip file. (This will be base location of your node js project)

3. Go to base location and run “npm start” command.

4. You should be able to see below message.

   Your server is listening on port 8080 ([http://localhost:8080](https://github.com/saviynt/ExternalConnectorFramework-APISpec/blob/main/README.md#steps-to-generate-node-js-server-bundle)). Swagger-ui is available on [http://localhost:8080/docs](https://github.com/saviynt/ExternalConnectorFramework-APISpec/blob/main/README.md#steps-to-generate-node-js-server-bundle).

   This will mean you have successfully started the node-js server.

## Steps to navigate the API spec.

1. Go to web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/docs](https://github.com/saviynt/ExternalConnectorFramework-APISpec/blob/main/README.md#steps-to-generate-node-js-server-bundle).
2. This will list all API spec supported by External Connector Framework.
3. There are various operations listed, as per your requirement, you can go to that specific API and use "Try it out" option to explore the API specification, which will list request type, request parameters, body and response. Note:
4. "Try it out" will require you to authorize with a bearer token, so you should first click on Authorize button at the top provide a value, this is a sample spec and there is no actual token validation, so you can provide any string value for e.g. MyBearerToken and click on Authorize -&gt; Close.
