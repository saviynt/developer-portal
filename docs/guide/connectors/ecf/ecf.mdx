# Overview

It is a new application integration framework that gives customers unparalleled flexibility and control to seamlessly integrate their third-party applications.

This framework establishes the standard OpenAPI specification. Customers can utilize this specification to create their own custom connectors that adhere to the provided standard. These connectors can then be integrated as an ECF application type in EIC. Since the custom connectors follow the standard specification, the integration into EIC will be smooth.

## **Key Features of the Framework:**

- Customer-managed infrastructure: Customers can deploy the custom connector as a target application on their infrastructure.

- Customer-managed build and deployment processes, and Time-To-Value (TTV): Since the custom connector is deployed on customer infrastructure, customers have complete control over the build and deployment processes, allowing them full control over TTV.

- Technology flexibility: The framework defines a language-agnostic API specification, enabling the development of custom connectors in any preferred programming language.
