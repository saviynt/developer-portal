# Overview

Saviynt Enterprise Identity Cloud (EIC) connectors provide integrations between EIC and external identity-aware applications. For most industry-standard applications, Saviynt offers dedicated connectors that can be configured by administrators and application owners. 
Saviynt allows application developers to create their own connectors.

In addition to connectors, Saviynt enables integration with various applications through Application Onboarding and Management (AOM). It is recommended to use the application onboarding capability to quickly onboard an application.

## Features

- **Certified Connectors**: Connectors link Enterprise Identity Cloud with identity-aware applications, directories, and databases. For more information about certified connectors, refer to [Saviynt Certified Connectors](link).

- **Saviynt Connector Framework**: This framework enables the development of custom connectors for home-grown applications or others for which Saviynt does not provide an out-of-the-box connector. For more information, see [Saviynt Connector Framework](link).

- **Community Sourced Connectors**: These connectors are built by partners and customers on top of the generic protocol-based framework. Utilize the corresponding documentation to build upon rather than starting from scratch. For more information, see [Community Sourced Connectors](link).
