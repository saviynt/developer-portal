# SCIM Integrations

## Overview
This guide explains how you can create various JSONs for a REST based application. The example provided here are specific to application that supports SCIM and the same principles applies to all other REST based applications.

## Understanding SCIM
SCIM stands for System for Cross-domain Identity Management, and it's a set of protocols that automates data provisioning across multiple domains. SCIM is an open standard that uses JSON, REST, and other authentication methods to standardize how identity information is shared between organizations. SCIM is often used to simplify the process of granting people access to cloud-based applications.

## Integration of SCIM with Saviynt via REST Connector
Saviynt's Enterprise Identity Cloud (EIC) can integrate with SCIM-based applications using its REST connector to manage user lifecycle and access controls efficiently. Here's how the integration generally works:

**Configuration of the REST Connector**
- **Connection Setup** Administrators set up a REST connection in Saviynt by specifying the endpoint URL, authentication credentials (such as OAuth, Basic Auth), and other necessary parameters like SSL certificates and vault configurations for secure connections.
- **Schema Definition** SCIM uses a predefined schema for user and group management, which should be mapped to Saviynt’s schema to ensure that the identity attributes in SCIM are correctly understood and processed by Saviynt.

**User Provisioning and Management**
- **Import Operations** Saviynt can perform full imports of users, accounts and their attributes and access from the SCIM service, adding them into the Saviynt management platform.
- **Provisioning Operations** Similarly, changes made within Saviynt, like creating or updating user profiles, can be pushed to the SCIM-based application, ensuring consistent identity data across systems.

**Deprovisioning and Access Management**
- **Removing Access** When access needs to be revoked, Saviynt can send appropriate commands via the REST connector to disable or delete accounts or modify entitlements in the SCIM service.

### Benefits of SCIM Integration via Saviynt's REST Connector
- Automated User Management: Reduces the administrative overhead by automating the creation, update, and deletion of user identities and their entitlements across different systems.
- Consistency and Compliance: Helps maintain consistency of identity data across platforms, aiding compliance with various regulatory requirements.
- Security: Offers robust security features, including support for secure connections, detailed access and change logs, and the ability to quickly revoke access when needed, reducing potential security risks.
- Efficiency and Accuracy: Minimizes manual errors and improves operational efficiency in managing user identities and access.

## Step by Step Instructions to onboard SCIM Applications
> 
> These instructions are specific to creating JSONs and do not detail all the activities that needs to be performed in Saviynt in order for these JSONs to be operational. Please refer to Saviynt documentation on how and where to use these jsons.

For the purpose of this guide, we will use Zscaler and build the relevant jsons.

### Step 1 - ConnectionJSON
The ConnectionJSON in the context of Saviynt's REST connector is a structured JSON object used to configure the connection parameters for integrating with an external application via REST APIs. This JSON configuration includes details about how to authenticate, communicate, and handle errors when interacting with the application's endpoints.

Refer to [ConnectionJSON In Depth](../concepts/connection-json.mdx) for detailed information about various attributes of ConnectionJSON and what to use when.

Zscaler supports OAuth2 authentication with Bearer token. In order to manage users and access using Saviynt in Zscaler, SCIM needs to be enabled in Zscaler
These steps are performed in the ZIA Admin Portal. For more information, see the applicable ZIA product documentation
1. Enable SCIM support for the selected IdP.
2. Make a note of these values because you’ll need them for the next step:
- Base URL
- Bearer token

The ConnectionJSON configuration will look like this - 
~~~ json
{
  "authentications": {
    "acctAuth": {
      "authType": "oauth2",
      "httpHeaders": {
        "contentType": "application/json"
      },
      "authError": [
        "InvalidAuthenticationToken",
        "AuthenticationFailed"
      ],
      "url": "<Base URL>",
      "httpMethod": "POST",
      "httpContentType": "application/json",
      "errorPath": "error.code",
      "maxRefreshTryCount": 5,
      "tokenResponsePath": "access_token",
      "tokenType": "Bearer",
      "authHeaderName": "Authorization",
      "accessToken": "<Bearer Token>",
      "httpParams": "[object Object]",
      "retryFailureStatusCode": []
    }
  }
}
~~~

**Breakdown of the connection json**

`authentications`
- This is the root element containing authentication configurations. Different authentications can be set up under this, identified by unique keys (in this case, `acctAuth`).

`acctAuth`
- This key identifies a specific authentication configuration which can be referenced in various integration tasks within Saviynt.

`authType`
- Indicates the authentication method, which is `oauth2` here, signifying that OAuth 2.0 protocol is used for securing API access.

`httpHeaders`
- Specifies additional headers to be sent with the API requests. Here, the `Content-Type` is set to `application/json`, indicating that the body of the HTTP requests will be formatted in JSON.

`authError`
- An array of error messages that could be expected when authentication fails. These specific errors will be used to identify authentication issues and trigger error handling workflows.

`url`
- The URL endpoint to which the REST API requests are made. The placeholder `<Base URL>` should be replaced with the actual tenant.

`httpMethod`
- Specifies the HTTP method used for requests, which is `POST` in this context. This is typical for API endpoints that initiate a new session or access token.

`httpContentType`
- Indicates the content type of the requests, reiterating that it is `application/json`.

`errorPath`
- JSON path in the response that points to where error messages are provided by the API. This helps in parsing and identifying error details from the response.

`maxRefreshTryCount`
- Specifies the maximum number of times the system should attempt to refresh the authentication token if the initial attempt fails, set to 5 in this case.

`tokenResponsePath`
- Specifies the path in the JSON response from which the access token can be extracted, important for handling the OAuth2 token lifecycle.

`tokenType`
- Defines the type of token, which is `Bearer` here. This is used in the `Authorization` header to provide the credential type.

`authHeaderName`
- The name of the HTTP header where the access token should be included, which is `Authorization` here.

`accessToken`
- The actual access token to be used for authentication. The placeholder `<access token>` needs to be replaced with a valid token.

`httpParams`
- Additional HTTP parameters for the request. It appears to be incorrectly formatted as "[object Object]" and should ideally be a JSON object detailing specific parameters.

`retryFailureStatusCode`
- An array of HTTP status codes that would trigger a retry of the request. It is empty in this configuration, suggesting no retries based on status codes are configured.

> Notes
>
> Error Handling
> - The `authError` and `errorPath` settings are critical for robust error handling, ensuring that the system can react appropriately to authentication failures or other API errors.
> 
> Security Considerations
> - Storing sensitive information like `accessToken` in plain text within configurations should be handled with care
> 
> Dynamic Elements
> - Elements like `<Base URL>` and `<Bearer Token>` suggest that this configuration should be dynamically populated with actual data during implementation.

This `ConnectionJSON` sets up the necessary parameters and structures to securely and effectively communicate with Zscaler SCIM endpoint.
